# Python Practice Examples

## This repository contains examples of my work while practicing the fundamentals of Python!

## Overview

- The "python_strings_numbers.py" file demonstrates the simplest forms of storing strings and numbers as variables, manipulating numbers and strings, creating and using f-strings, and examples of arithmetic operators.
- The "lists_tuples_sets_dicts.py" file demonstrates basics on working with lists, the unique properties of tuples, and touches on how we can create and work with dictionaries.
- The "if_elif_else_and_loops.py" file goes over how to set up conditions using conditional operators and booleans and how to incorporate them into loops. Furthermore, the file goes over the basics on how to create "for" and "while" loops as well as some best practices
- The "functions.py" file demonstrates basics when creating and calling functions and lambdas.
- The modules folder contains examples on how to import modules, calling functions from modules, and shows examples of built in modules from the Python library. Additionally, the "os_module.py" file goes into further detail on the os module and some of the useful methods found in that module.
- The read_write_to_files folder contains work detailing best practice one should follow when opening files in scripts. The "read_write_to_files.py" file also demonstrates how we can read information from text files, how to write text, and how to iterate through certain lines when reading in data or writing data to another file.
